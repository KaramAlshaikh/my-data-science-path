Don't worry. You can fight back. Windows has long offered a way 
for you to view and disable your startup programs. In older versions
 of Windows, youâ€™d open the System Configuration tool (msconfig) where you could see and 
 deselect any programs you wanted to stop loading automatically. That option is no longer available
  in Windows 10. Instead, you can check out your startup programs in a couple of other ways.

You can go through the Settings screen, where you can see each app, its current status,
 and the effect if you opt to disable it from starting up automatically. Another option is to go
  through Task Manager, where you can scour the list of startup programs, research each specific
  program on the web to learn what it does, and then disable any apps you feel don't need to launch at startup.
